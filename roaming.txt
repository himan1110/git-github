in this video I will show you how to use

Windows Server 2016 to deploy roaming

users profiles to Windows client

computers if your enrollment is not

already set up with 
roaming user

preference the first step is to create

security group that contains all the

users to which you want to apply a

roaming user profile settings so let's

open 
active refuses and computers

concern and here you can see we have a

one oh you name we one and under you one

I have a total 5 test users that is

stage choose a 
one - please choose a

file and we have a one group name Group

1 all five users are member of our group

Group one so we have a one security

group name Group one 
and we will use

this group close and permission on the

share folder

so before we configure a roaming profile

settings for user account we need to

create a share
 folder so let's open this

PC and last back on DJ let's create one

folder named profile let's share this

folder by right-clicking on it and

select properties click 
on sharing tab

click on advanced sharing select share

this folder and the share name will be

profile but you want to create the share

as a hidden shape that I am going
 to put

dollar sign at the end of the share name

now let's click on the permissions as

you can see everyone have default to

read only for me sure let's give them a

full
 control let's click on apply the

one ok again click on apply and ok now

we need to set up and if his commission

as well so let's click on security tab

click on advanced
 now first of all I'm

going to disable inheritance select

convert inheritor Commission into

expedition permission on this object and

that's remove both user century
 because

by default every user from our domain if

a member of my lap slash uses group and

we don't want that user have a certain

permission on this share folder as 
we

continue now let's click on Add button

click on select a principal and here we

have to specify the name of our group

that is group 1 to construct me to

verify that
 group ok

that's become okay now permission will

be allowed but that permission only

applies to this folder only now let's

click on show advanced permission and

select
 create files and write data and

create food is in obtain get a

permission as well thus we going to a

stick on apply and okay now our share

folder is ready to use the
 Indus click

on sharing tab copy the network path and

click on loose now one next step is to

configure domain users profile settings

let's move back to add projectory
 users

in computers consume and select our user

just choose a one practically and select

properties you can also select multiple

users by pressing ctrl key and select
ing

users this will enables you to configure

roaming user profile for multiple users

in single session we will see it later

let's click on profile now let's place

the
 chef who dispatch and type slash now

here you can specify it or santal you

 same for these two so 3 as well

Asli come okay so now we have

successfully configured the roaming is

using preferred settings for our test

users so next time when 
they use a way

log on to domain his profile will be

saved in a subfolder

which will be created under profiles

shared folder the name of the subfolder

will be the name 
of the user for whom

your roaming profile is configured if we

check it under profile folders right now

we do not have any folder so let's paste

roaming user profile 
settings for our

Active Directory user so this is the our

Windows 10 client computer and this

computer is a part of our activity to

mean to taste roaming user profiles
 we

can sign into this Windows 10 computer

using the user account on which we have

configured room user profile settings

let's use our user 1 screen ischial and

we'll
 ask for the password and hit enter

that's create one shortcut for seeing

the office now after creating person

from client

computer now user profiles will be saved

back in the share folder which we

configure for roaming user profile let's

move back to our server and here you 
can

see we have a 1 folder named user 1 dot

avi file leaf I stand for this user

of NTFS permission let's click on the

continue and here we go

one now to verify use swimming profile

let's open system properties thus click

on advanced system settings but 
as you

know standard user does not have

permission to view advanced system

settings but for this demonstration I'm

going to use the credential of our

domain administrator
 click on yes on the

user profiles click on settings and here

you can see my lap / user one has a

roaming profile type so from this we can

confirm that we have 
successfully

configured the roaming profile for our

use of one and that's it for this video
